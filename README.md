This is my first attempt at a larger Python script and adding a GUI. I am sure I made countless mistakes.

I got most of my info from [John Elder Codemy.com YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCC34OHNcOtoC6GglhF3ncJ5rLwQrLGnV)

You have to enter your trades manually. But this tracks your trades and your dollar cost averages.
There is an option in the dropdown to print a pdf report of all your trades. (It's ugly AF right now.)

# ADD NEW
Uses today's date, Select an event, The stock/Crypto name, Cost is how much you spent, Shares/Coins is how much you got and Price is the Price per Share/Coin.
# Update Record
You have to select a record then make the changes and click the "Update Record" Button.
# Delete Selected
Kinda obvious, select a record and then delete it.
# Clear Entry
Just clears the entry boxes.
# Holdings
The tree view on the right shows your all time holdings. If you sold all for a loss they are red and profits are green. Sorted by Shares/Coins.
