## General Information
- My first attempt at a GUI.
- My first attempt at a larger project.
- I wanted a better way to track my investments.


## Technologies Used
- Python 3.9.9
- tkinter
- sqlite3
- pillow
- pandas
- os


## Features
- You have to enter your trades manually. But this tracks your trades and your dollar cost averages.
- There is an option in the dropdown to print a pdf report of all your trades. (It's ugly AF right now.)
- Add a new trade. Uses today's date, Select an event, The stock/Crypto name, Cost is how much you spent, Shares/Coins is how much you got and Price is the Price per Share/Coin.
- Update a record. You have to select a record then make the changes and click the "Update Record" Button.
- Delete selected. Kinda obvious, select a record and then delete it.
- Clear Entry. Just clears the entry boxes.
- The tree view on the right shows your all time holdings. If you sold all for a loss they are red and profits are green. Sorted by Shares/Coins.

## Setup
- You will need all the images and icons in the [Images](https://github.com/Babaganoush07/invesments_python/tree/main/Images) folder.
- And change the file paths for all the pictures and pdf stuff.


## Project Status
Project is: _complete_ 


## Room for Improvement
With this being my first go of it. Everything needs improvement.
